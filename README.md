#Digital-Filter-Design-For-Low-Frequency-Assets

Abstract

Financial time series is a series of digital data points in successive order taken over a specified interval of time. The data points considered for this project are the closing prices of an asset. The financial asset i.e. the stock price follows trends and drives the market in a certain direction. Financial analysts all over the world use financial time series to predict market movement using mathematical models or estimators. Two of the most popular estimators used for estimation of the trends are leading and lagging estimators. The leading estimators have high prediction rate, whereas the lagging estimators have a large latency period, as a result lagging estimators are always behind the market movement. The goal of the project is to improve the design of a lagging estimator i.e. a Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) Filter using filter design techniques. We have used minimum phase filter design methodology to improve the design of lagging estimator by minimizing the Group Delay (grd)

Conclusion

The frequency response and other parameters of the Moving
Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) filter are
rectified. The new filter design shows less group delay. The
improved Minimum Phase filter displays larger accuracy in
predicting trends of a low-frequency signal when compared
to MACD. As the goal of an investor in financial markets is
to maximize profit returns, this is possible when a trend
analysis happens in real time. Itâ€™s safe to say, investors can
mitigate their risks by using the Minimum Phase Filter
design compared to Moving Average Convergence
Divergence.
