# Digital-Filter-Design-For-Low-Frequency-Assets
Financial time series

Financial time series is a series of digital data points in successive order taken over a specified interval of time. The data points considered for this project are the closing prices of asset. The financial asset i.e. the stock price follows trends and drives the market in a certain direction. Financial analysts all over the world use financial time series to predict market movement using mathematical models or estimators. Two of the most popular estimators used for estimation of the trends are leading and lagging estimators. The leading estimators have high prediction rate, whereas the lagging estimators have a large latency period, as a result lagging estimators are always behind the market movement. The goal of the project is to improve the design of a lagging estimator i.e. a Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) Filter using filter design techniques. We have used minimum phase filter design methodology to improve the design of lagging estimator by minimizing the Group Delay (grd)
